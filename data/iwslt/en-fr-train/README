IWSLT 2012 evaluation campaign: training/development data

# Copyright: TED Conference LLC
# License: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0

For each language pair x-y, the in-domain parallel training data is
provided through the following files:

train.tags.x-y.x
train.tags.x-y.y

They include transcripts and manual translations of the talks
available at the TED website for each pair x-y in June 2012. The talks
included in the development (and forthcoming evaluation) sets have been
removed.

The transcripts are given as pure text (UTF8 encoding), one or more
sentences per line, and are aligned (at language pair level, not
across pairs). The simplified set of characters is employed for
Chinese text. No segmentation/preprocessing has been applied to Arabic
nor to Chinese.

Monolingual training data is included in the file:

train.y

while for tuning/development purposes, the following files are
released:

IWSLT12.TALK.dev2010.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT12.TALK.dev2010.x-y.y.xml
IWSLT12.TALK.tst2010.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT12.TALK.tst2010.x-y.y.xml
